## Welcome to the BoxLang Servlet Runtime

This BoxLang Servlet Runtime is a Java Servlet implementation of the BoxLang language. This runtime allows you to run BoxLang code in a Java Servlet environment. This runtime is built on top of the BoxLang Core runtime and the BoxLang Java runtime.  You can find the full docs here: https://boxlang.ortusbooks.com/getting-started/running-boxlang/commandbox

## What is BoxLang?

**BoxLang** is a modern dynamic JVM language that can be deployed on multiple runtimes: operating system (Windows/Mac/*nix/Embedded), web server, lambda, iOS, android, web assembly, and more. **BoxLang** combines many features from different programming languages, including Java, ColdFusion, Python, Ruby, Go, and PHP, to provide developers with a modern and expressive syntax.

**BoxLang** has been designed to be a highly adaptable and dynamic language to take advantage of all the modern features of the JVM and was designed with several goals in mind:

* Be a rapid application development (RAD) scripting language and middleware.
* Unstagnate the dynamic language ecosystem in Java.
* Be dynamic, modular, lightweight, and fast.
* Be 100% interoperable with Java.
* Be modern, functional, and fluent (Think mixing CFML, Node, Kotlin, Java, and Clojure)
* Be able to support multiple runtimes and deployment targets:
  * Native OS Binaries (CLI Tooling, compilers, etc.)
  * MiniServer
  * Servlet Containers - CommandBox/Tomcat/Jetty/JBoss
  * JSR223 Scripting Engines
  * AWS Lambda
  * Microsoft Azure Functions (Coming Soon)
  * Android/iOS Devices (Coming Soon)
  * Web assembly (Coming Soon)
* Compile down to Java ByteCode
* Allow backward compatibility with the existing ColdFusion/CFML language.
* Great IDE, Debugger and Tooling: https://boxlang.ortusbooks.com/getting-started/ide-tooling
* Scripting (Any OS and Shebang) and REPL capabilities
